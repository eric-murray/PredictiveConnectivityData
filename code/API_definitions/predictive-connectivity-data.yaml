  description: >-
    # Introduction

    With the Dynamic Predictive Connectivity Data API, the consumer can retrieve an estimation of connectivity delivered by 4/5G networks along a volume/area for a future date, time and height.

    This functionality can be used for multiple use cases, some of the possible use cases for this API are:

    - Network Airspace Connectivity Information for Drones: supporting drone flight planning with detailed analysis of mobile network coverage in the airspace across specific geographic areas.

    - Mobile Network Analysis for Autonomous Cars: enabling route planning through in-depth evaluation of mobile network availability.

    The list above is just a few examples, the API can be used for other use cases as well.

    # Relevant Definitions and concepts

    * **AGL**: Means "Above Ground Level" and describes the vertical height
    above the ground.

    * **Service Level**: Describes, in measurable terms, the quality of service
    a telecommunication provider furnishes a consumer within a given time period.

    * **Network Type**: Refers to the type of connectivity (4G/5G) for which to retrieve data.

    * **Signal Strength**: Raw signal strength measurements in dBm that can be optionally included in the response when supported by the implementation.

    * **Notification URL and token**: Developers may provide a callback URL (`sink`) for receiving an async response.
    This is an optional parameter. If `sink` is included, it is RECOMMENDED for the client to provide as well the `sinkCredential`
    property to protect the notification endpoint. In the current version,`sinkCredential.credentialType` MUST be set to `ACCESSTOKEN` if provided.
    When an asynchronous response is requested, the 202 response of the API will include an `operationId` property. This `operationId` property will
    also be sent in the callback notification. The purpose of the `operationId` is to correlate an asynchronous response with its corresponding request.


    # API Functionality

    Once a developer specifies (1) the area as a polygon shape, (2) a precision level, (3) the service
    level and (4) time interval in which they want to obtain the connectivity estimation,
    the API returns a data set consisting of a sequence of time ranges, with each
    time range containing the input polygon subdivided into equal-sized grid cells.

    For each of the equal-sized cells of the grid, an analysis of Connectivity Levels
    is reported for each time slot within the range, this includes data classified into:

      - `GC`: Means good connectivity. Service level met even in unfavorable conditions.
      - `MC`: Means marginal connectivity. Service level might not be met.
      - `NC`: Means no connectivity. Service level not met.
      - `ND`: No connectivity data.

    Optionally, if supported by the implementation and requested by the client, raw signal strength values in dBm can also be returned for each layer.

    These values are calculated based on network data and/or prediction models trained on
    such data.

    The polygon provided must comply with certain restrictions, which must be
    previously validated by the developer:

      - The polygon will not exceed a certain area.
      - The polygon cannot have an arbitrary complexity (unlimited number of
      sides, complex shapes, etc.).
      - The polygon must be associated with a location where the telco provides
      mobile connectivity services. Cells outside the area supported by the
      implementation will not be returned. Therefore, if a polygon is located
      entirely outside the supported area, an empty array will be returned.

    The standard behaviour of the API is synchronous, although for large
    area requests the API may behave asynchronously. An API invoker can enforce
    asynchronous behaviour by providing a callback URL (sink) in the request,
    in this case the API sends a callback to the callback URL provided with the
    result of the request. If sink is included, it is RECOMMENDED for the
    client to provide as well the sinkCredential property to protect the
    notification endpoint. In the current version, sinkCredential.credentialType
    MUST be set to ACCESSTOKEN if provided. When an asynchronous response is
    requested, the 202 response of the API will include an `operationId`
    property. This `operationId` property will also be sent in the callback
    notification. The purpose of the `operationId` is to correlate an
    asynchronous response with its corresponding request.

    ## Error handling:

    For requests with a combination of area, precision, startTime and endTime
    properties involving an amount of processing that cannot be processed
    synchronously, the API returns the error response
    PREDICTIVE_CONNECTIVITY_DATA.UNSUPPORTED_SYNC_RESPONSE.

    For requests with a combination of area, precision, startTime and endTime
    properties too big for both synchronous and asynchronous processing, the API
    returns the error response PREDICTIVE_CONNECTIVITY_DATA.UNSUPPORTED_REQUEST.

    If an error happens during the asynchronous processing of the request. The
    API callback will have property status with value OPERATION_NOT_COMPLETED
    as an error cannot be returned in the callback. The callback will also
    include the statusInfo property to add extra information about the error.

    NOTE: In case the property "Technology" is not included, the quality of connectivity
    will be returned considering both 4G and 5G networks.

    # Resources and Operations overview

    The API provides one endpoint that accepts POST requests for obtaining the
    connectivity in a concrete area for a concrete service level and network
    type/s.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses

    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.
